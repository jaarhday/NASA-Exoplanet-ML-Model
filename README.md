# Overview

As a Computer Science student, I'm constantly looking for opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge, and one effective way to do this is by working on real-world projects. For this project, I obtained a dataset from a reputable [source](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=k2pandc), which I'll use to practice my data analysis and machine learning skills.

The dataset I'm analyzing contains information about exoplanets discovered by the Kepler space telescope. It includes various attributes such as planet radius, mass, equilibrium temperature, and more. I obtained the dataset from NASA's Exoplanet Archive website.

The purpose of writing this software is to perform exploratory data analysis on the exoplanet dataset and develop machine learning models to predict certain properties of exoplanets. By doing so, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of exoplanets and improve my data analysis and machine learning skills.

# Data Analysis Results

### Questions and Answers:
1. What is the distribution of planet radii in the dataset?
   - The distribution of planet radii shows that most exoplanets have a radius similar to Earth or are within a certain range of Earth's radius.
2. How does the distribution of planet masses compare to Earth's mass?
   - The histogram of planet masses indicates that most exoplanets have a mass significantly smaller than Earth's mass.
3. What is the distribution of equilibrium temperatures of the discovered exoplanets?
   - The distribution of equilibrium temperatures shows a wide range of temperatures, with some exoplanets having extremely high or low temperatures.
4. How does the insolation flux vary among the exoplanets?
   - The histogram of insolation flux demonstrates variations in the amount of energy received by the exoplanets from their host stars.
5. How many stars are typically found in systems with exoplanets?
   - Most systems with exoplanets contain a single star, although there are a few systems with multiple stars.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Python as the programming language along with various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express, and Scikit-learn. I worked in a Jupyter Notebook environment to analyze the data and develop machine learning models.
